# Define a same_first_and_last_letter method that accepts a string. 
# The method should return true if the first and last character are equal, 
# and false otherwise.
# Assume the string will always have 1 or more characters.
#
# Examples:

def same_first_and_last_letter(name)


    name[0] == name[-1]
end
# The => indicates the expected return value
#
# same_first_and_last_letter("runner")   => true
# same_first_and_last_letter("Runner")   => false
# same_first_and_last_letter("clock")    => false
# same_first_and_last_letter("q")        => true



# Define a three_number_sum method that accepts a 3-character string.
# The method should calculate the sum of the digits of the string. 
# HINT: You’ll have to figure out a way to convert the
# string-ified digits to integers.
#

def three_number_sum(name)

    numone = name[0].to_i
    numtwo = name[1].to_i
    numthree = name[2].to_i

    numone + numtwo + numthree
end
# Examples:
# The => indicates the expected return value
#
# three_number_sum("123")   => 6
# three_number_sum("567")   => 18
# three_number_sum("444")   => 12
# three_number_sum("000")   => 0
